# Data-Mining-Final-Project
Montana State University CSCI 347: Data Mining Final Project

Project Summary:

The problem that I explore in this project is that of automizing the classification of mushrooms as poisonous or edible based on their observed physical attributes and habitat. The [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom) is comprised of 8,124 instances, each with 22 categorical attributes. There are 2,480 missing attribute values all located in attribute 11. The data is already labeled as either poisonous or edible. I further explore classification algorithms with this project by using the Na√Øve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to classify this data.
